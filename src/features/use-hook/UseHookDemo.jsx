        <p>Use hooks allow you to define reusable operations that can be triggered from anywhere in your app, without needing to pass callbacks down through props.</p>
        <p>In this demo, we'll show how to create and use actions for common tasks like adding items to a cart, updating user profiles, and more.</p>
